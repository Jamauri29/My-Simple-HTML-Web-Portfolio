<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m an educator, linguist, and curriculum designer who is passionate about making learning engaging and meaningful. Whether I’m developing UX design courses for Noble Desktop, structuring a technical roadmap for a role at Google, or exploring how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript connect through the lens of traditional linguistics, I always look for ways to make complex ideas accessible. I enjoy working with learners of all backgrounds—from young children to professionals—incorporating active learning techniques to create experiences that are interactive and relevant. My goal is always to bridge disciplines in a way that deepens understanding and encourages curiosity.</p>

<p>Beyond education, I have a deep interest in language, culture, and emerging technology. I’m particularly focused on Papiamentu, especially the Curaçao variant, and I’m currently working on a project related to the language. At the same time, I’m learning Czech, aiming for A2 proficiency with a focus on morphosyntactical structures and sociolinguistic context. I also enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and storytelling, which has led me to work with Sora, where I’m experimenting with ways to create long-form, seamless video narratives that flow naturally.</p>

<p>A few things that might give insight into what excites me: I love discovering hidden and lesser-known languages, which is why I found an Africa Daily Podcast episode on the topic particularly fascinating. I also enjoy finding smart ways to travel, ensuring I get the best experience and value—like when I was planning my trip to Thailand. And lately, I’ve been diving deeper into AI, working on training ChatGPT to develop the best possible OpenAI schema for a custom-built LLM/GPT model. I love the challenge of blending education, technology, and cultural preservation, and I’m always looking for ways to push my own understanding while creating something useful for others.</p>
